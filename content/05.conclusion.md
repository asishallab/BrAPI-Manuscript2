## Conclusion

The BrAPI project only exists because of the community of software engineers, biologists, and other scientists who support and use it. While there were many tools and use cases presented here, it is not an exhaustive list of all BrAPI-compliant systems. As long as the standard continues to be supported, the community will continue to expand. As more groups continue to make their tools BrAPI compliant, others will see the value in implementing BrAPI into their own tools, allowing the community to strengthen and grow. By providing an open standard for breeding data, and the infrastructure and community to support it, the BrAPI project is doing its part to support a productive agricultural system amidst the pressing challenges of climate change. If this manuscript is your first introduction to the BrAPI project, the authors invite you to join the community. More information is available at [brapi.org](https://brapi.org).
