#### DeltaBreed

<!-- Shawn Y.-->
[DeltaBreed](https://app.breedinginsight.net/) is an open-source breeding data management system designed and developed by [Breeding Insight](https://breedinginsight.org/) to support U.S. Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) specialty crop and animal breeders. DeltaBreed differs from other related systems in that it is customizable to small breeding teams and generalized enough to support the workflows of diverse species. DeltaBreed is a unified system that connects a variety of BrAPI applications. BrAPI integration allows the complexity underlying interoperability to be hidden, shielding users from multifactorial differences between various applications. DeltaBreed, adhering to the BrAPI model, establishes data standards and validations for users and provides a singular framework for data management and user training. BrAPI enabled connections are being used with all of the following tools: [BrAPI Java Test Server](https://test-server.brapi.org/brapi/v2/), [BreedBase](https://breedbase.org/), [Field Book](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fieldbook.tracker), [Gigwa](https://gigwa.southgreen.fr/gigwa/), [QBMS](https://icarda-git.github.io/QBMS), [Mr Bean](https://github.com/AparicioJohan/MrBeanApp), [Helium](https://helium.hutton.ac.uk/#/) and the [Pedigree Viewer](https://github.com/solgenomics/BrAPI-Pedigree-Viewer) BrAPP. 

DeltaBreed users may not be aware of BrAPI or the specifics of underlying tools, but will notice that BrAPI interoperability reduces the need for human-mediated file transfers and data manipulation. Field Book users, for example, can connect to their DeltaBreed program, authenticate, and pull studies and observation variables directly from DeltaBreed to Field Book on their data collection device. The subsequent step of pushing observations from Field Book to DeltaBreed is straightforward via BrAPI, but is pending implementation until data quality validations are put in place; these include improved data transaction handling and differentiation of intentional and inadvertent repeated measures.
